				Hello Friend! Welcome to this website containing gardening knowledge passed down across the ages from master to student. If you are reading this, then either you heard the call in your bones, or happen to be teaching/ taking a course in cs80 at santa monica. Either way, you've come to the right place.

		<h3>What is a succulent?</h3>

				The succulent is a plant native to drier parts of this world. They are usually distinguished from other plants by their fleshy plump leaves that the plants use to store water for later use. Succulents come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and humans have cloned and hybridized the many wild varieties into even more interesting sub species. Succulents are relatively cheap and widely available. A baby succulent runs you about 3 dollars at your local nursery.

				Succulents are prized and cultivated by gardners the world over becuase of their sheer beauty. They are available in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. Even more interesting, for those of you out their that might love mathematics. Succulents are a prime example of the majestic patterns that nature displays and the geometric shapes of the petal arrangements confrom to mathematical ratios like the golden number phi.

		<h3>Where to grow them</h3>

				Succulents love sunlight. However, they are extremely tough plants and can adopt to a wide variety of lighting conditons. Bigger and more mature succulents love to be grown in full strong light with soil that drains well. If you live in Los Angeles, the plants grow the best and fastest in the southern end of your home. However, we happen to be blessed with near perfect weather year round so these little guys are happy to be grown anywhere you have space for them. They also grow well indoors in little jars placed by windows. A pro-tip I learned from my sensei-- baby succulents actually grow best in shaded sunlight. So a good place to grow them until they are bigger is the porch.

		<h3>Care</h3>
			<p>
				The fastest way to kill succulents is frost damage, which if you live in LA you'd never have to worry about, and overwatering. Overwatering is probably the biggest culprit behnind failed succulents. These guys are designed to store water and survive drought, but their leaves can only store so much water and will die from root rot if left in stagnant soil. A good rule of thumb is to water them in the morning or evening to avoid damaging the plants from sun scorch in mid day, and to water when the soil is dry, or about every few weeks.
			</p>
		<h3>Replication</h3>
			<p>
				One of the most interesting things to do with succulents is to clone them. All it takes to produce a new baby of your older plant is to remove a petal and place it on top of some soil in a pot. Wait a few weeks and that little petal will sprout a new flower crown and start to send out roots in search of water and soil. Once the baby has emerged from the petal, give it tiny amount of water and watch it grow into a whole other plant!

				Another technique is to slice a branch of a succulent off and let it sit out in the air for a day or two until the wound has healed and calloused. New roots will actually pop out from the callous and create a whole other plant too! 

				Replicating them is very fun and lets you appreciate the resiliance of the cycle of life. Not to mention, in no time flat, you'll have plenty of babies to give to your friends and be able to spread the fun of plants and gardening.

		<h3>Benefits of Gardening</h3>
			<p>
				In this modern world we live in full of concrete, computers, and cities, it is nice to be able to reconnect with the natural world that we somtimes forget that we are a part of. Gardening is a peaceful and calming activity, studies have shown that residents in cities report greater happiness the closer they are to parks, tree's and greenery. 

				A simple trip into the wilds of the mountains and forests is enough to convince anyone of the calming and therapeutic qualities of the great outdoors. Through gardening and succulents, we can reconnect with all this and more.
